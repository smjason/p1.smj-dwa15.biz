<h1>Project One</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2> Scott Jason Bio</h2>
<p>I have been in the information technology field for around fourteen years. I have created websites along the way and have taken various classes that will count towards my computer science degree at the Harvard Extension School. I am happy to be in a field that I enjoy as it is both challenging and ever-changing. I am also blessed to be working at Harvard University amongst so many brilliant people. I am looking forward to what this class has to offer.</p>
<p>This is a simple proof of concept site created with Dreamweaver CS5.</p>
