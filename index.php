<h1>Project One</h1>

<h2> Scott Jason Bio</h2>
<p>I have been in the information technology field for around 14 years. I have created wesites along the way and have taken various classes that will count towards my computer science degree at the Harvard Extension School. I am happy to be in a field that I enjoy as it is challenging and also ever changing. </p>
<p>This is a simple proof of concept site created with Dreamweaver CS5.</p>
